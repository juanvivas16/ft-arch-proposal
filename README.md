# AWS FT DevOps Challenge

This repository contains my proposal for the technical challenge. It includes two tasks: the first focuses on designing and diagramming an architecture with a front-end and back-end in AWS, emphasizing cost-efficiency, security, and high availability. The second task involves building a secure and scalable infrastructure using Terraform, followed by testing its availability and scalability.

I hope the proposal meets your expectations, and any feedback or suggestions for improvement are always welcome.

## Task 1: High-Level Architecture Proposal
In this section, we design a proposal for the AWS infrastructure using **Draw.io** as the diagramming tool.
